# Markdown Templates

The following sections describe some useful snippets that can be used in the documentation.

## External Links

External links are rendered such that it is clear that those will open in a separate tab leading to external sources.

```html
<a href="http://example.com/" target="_blank">Hello, world!</a>
```

## TODOs

```markdown
---
<font color="red">**TODO:**</font> **outdated, needs some work...**
---
```
